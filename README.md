# dbdump
A simple yet effective dbdump utility based on the excellent [https://github.com/ifsnop/mysqldump-php](MySQLDump - PHP) by [https://github.com/ifsnop](ifsnop)

##Foreword
I need a quick and dirty script to generate a MySQL dump before a project commit. I used the original MySQLDump and wrapped it with a zip compressor.

##Use
The use is very straigthforward, just drop it in your project folder, configure it and run. It will generate a compressed db dump.
